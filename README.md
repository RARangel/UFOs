# Module 11 Challenge: UFOs

## Overview of Project

To create a web page on UFO sightings that allows users to filter for multiple criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape) at the same time. 

## Deliverables:

- index.html [file](index.html)
- app.js [file](https://github.com/RARangel/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js)
- data.js[file](https://github.com/RARangel/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)

## Results: 

To use the wb page - enter any search criteria in a text box on the left.

## Summary: 

One drawback of this new design is the lack of smart text completions. Two recommendations for further development:  enable a drop down list of valid values to enable a faster filter. Also allow the cell to auto-completion user input.
