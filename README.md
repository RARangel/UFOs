# Module 11 Challenge: UFOs

## Overview of Project

To create a web page on UFO sightings that allows users to filter for multiple criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape) at the same time. 

## Deliverables:

- index.html [file](index.html)
- app.js [file](Static).
- data.js 

## Results: 

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary: 

One drawback of this new design is the lack of smart text completions. Two recommendations for further development:  enable a drop down list of valid values to enable a faster filter. Also allow the cell to auto-completion user input.
